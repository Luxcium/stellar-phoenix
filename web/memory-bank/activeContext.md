# Active Context

- Current task: Configuring development servers with watch mode for incremental development

## Current Work Focus

- Implementation of automated development watch scripts
- Integration of Memory Bank monitoring into development workflow
- Enhancement of development workflow with interactive setup options
- Ensuring stable state restoration during development

### Current Work

- Enhanced `setup.sh` with interactive development mode selection
- Created `dev-watch.sh` script for monitoring and parallel development server execution
- Added npm scripts for different development scenarios (watch, dev:watch, etc.)
- Implemented Memory Bank monitoring for continuous context awareness
- Documented development workflow in system patterns
- Added basic login and registration pages with Prisma API

## Recent Changes

- Optimisations du pipeline de traitement de données
- Implémentation de techniques d'accélération des performances
- Réduction des accès disques et optimisation d'utilisation mémoire
- Gestion efficace des ressources CPU via workers
- Configured Next.js app structure
- Set up Tailwind CSS integration
- Created enhanced UI with hover effects

## Next Steps

- Configure and test nodemon for backend development
- Implement more comprehensive error handling in watch mode
- Create development metrics collection for performance monitoring
- Enhance the Memory Bank monitoring with more detailed information
- Configurer un benchmarking des optimisations

## Active Decisions

- Use concurrently to run multiple watch processes in parallel
- Implement Memory Bank monitoring for continuous context awareness
- Provide interactive mode selection for different development scenarios
- Use colored terminal output for better visibility of different processes
- Default to watch mode for faster development feedback

## Current Status

- Development watch scripts implemented and functional
- Interactive setup providing multiple development mode options
- Memory Bank monitoring integrated into development workflow
- npm scripts configured for different development scenarios
- Documentation updated to reflect new development workflow
