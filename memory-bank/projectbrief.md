# Project Brief

## Overview

The TFTDD (Type-First Test-Driven Development) template provides a structured foundation for building type-safe, well-tested TypeScript applications. It combines the principles of Type-First development with Test-Driven Development, enhanced by AI integration and comprehensive documentation through the Memory Bank system.

## Project Goals

* Create a robust template for Type-First Test-Driven Development
* Provide tools and patterns for type-safe application development
* Integrate AI assistance for development workflows
* Maintain comprehensive, living documentation
* Ensure code quality through automated testing and validation

## Core Requirements

1. Type System
   * Strong type safety with TypeScript
   * Runtime type validation with Zod
   * Type-safe error handling
   * Type documentation generation
   * [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
   * [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)

2. Testing Infrastructure
   * Jest with @jest/globals for type-safe testing
   * Mandatory TDD workflow with pre-commit hooks
   * Type testing capabilities with strict safety (no 'any')
   * IsolatedModules enabled for better performance
   * Test coverage reporting and enforcement
   * Automated test execution via Husky
   * [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript)
   * [ts-jest](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/docs/)

3. AI Integration
   * Type generation assistance
   * Test case generation
   * Code quality suggestions
   * Documentation assistance
   * [Cline AI Documentation](https://docs.cline.bot/)
   * [Cline GitHub](https://github.com/cline/cline)

4. Documentation System
   * Memory Bank implementation
   * TypeDoc integration
   * Markdown documentation
   * Example-driven documentation
   * [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/)
   * [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/)
   * [Cline Memory Bank](https://docs.cline.bot/improving-your-prompting-skills/custom-instructions-library/cline-memory-bank)

5. Development Environment
   * VSCode integration
   * Automated formatting and linting
   * Debug configurations
   * Task automation

## Scope

### In Scope

* Core type system implementation
* Test infrastructure setup
* Development environment configuration
* Documentation system implementation
* Basic AI integration foundations
* Example implementations and patterns

### Out of Scope

* Application-specific business logic
* Complex AI model training
* External service integrations
* Deployment configurations
* Production monitoring setup

## Success Criteria

1. Technical Criteria
   * 100% TypeScript strict mode compliance
   * >90% test coverage
   * Zero linting errors
   * Complete type documentation
   * All tests passing

2. Documentation Criteria
   * Complete Memory Bank documentation
   * Generated API documentation
   * Clear usage examples
   * Development workflow guides

3. Developer Experience
   * Seamless development environment setup
   * Automated quality checks
   * Clear error messages
   * Efficient debugging support

## Timeline

1. Phase 1: Core Implementation
   * Basic project structure
   * Type system foundation
   * Test infrastructure

2. Phase 2: Documentation
   * Memory Bank setup
   * TypeDoc integration
   * Usage examples

3. Phase 3: AI Integration
   * AI assistance tools
   * Code generation utilities
   * Development workflow integration

## Stakeholders

* Development Team
  * TypeScript developers
  * Test engineers
  * Documentation maintainers

* End Users
  * Application developers
  * Project maintainers
  * Documentation readers

## Notes

* This project emphasizes maintainable, type-safe code over rapid development
* Documentation is treated as a first-class citizen
* AI integration should enhance, not replace, developer decision-making
* The template should be adaptable to various project types while maintaining its core principles
